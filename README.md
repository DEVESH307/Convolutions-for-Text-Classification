## Project Objective
- Implemented a deep learning classification model, employed word embedding with GloVe & used 1D Convolutions with Keras to detect different types of toxic comment 
- Used Wikipedia dataset and train the model for 3 epochs and achieved 0.9597 train accuracy and 0.9606 test accuracy 




# Convolutions for Text Classification with Keras!

## Welcome!
Welcome to **Convolutions for Text Classification with Keras!**.The Kaggle competition for toxic comment classification about detection of different types of toxic comments by classifying them into one or more labels from ‘toxic’, ‘severe_toxic’, ‘obscene’, ‘threat’, ‘insult’ and ‘identity_hate’. The challenge is particularly interesting because of the heated discussions that toxic content online has influenced the overall health of the society. It is also interesting that the service providers are finally leveraging deep learning to supervise their service in a scalable way.

Google’s Conversation AI team, a research initiative with Alphabet, deals with classifying toxic comments using various models that can be tested using [Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/#/home). But, their model does not have an option to select a toxicity level in an online comment or a given text.

The objective is to develop pre-defined models and improve their accuracy as compared to the outputs provided by Perspective API.

## Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

1. Apply Word Embeddings for Text Classification
2. Use 1D Convolutions as Feature Extractors for Text in NLP
3. Perform Binary Text Classification using Deep Learning with Keras

This is a hands-on, guided introduction to Text Classification using 1D Convolutions with Keras. As a case study, we will work on classifying a large number of Wikipedia comments as being either toxic or not (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). This issue is especially important, given the conversations the global community and tech companies are having on content moderation, online harassment, and inclusivity. The data set we will use comes from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).

To complete this guided project, we recommend that you have prior experience in Python programming, deep learning theory, and have used either Tensorflow or Keras to build deep learning models. We assume you have this foundational knowledge and want to learn how to use convolutions in NLP tasks such as classification.

For a deep-dive into using CNNs on text data, please take a few minutes to read this fantastic piece on Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks in NLP by [Denny Britz](https://twitter.com/dennybritz), a past resident on the [Google Brain team](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) where he worked on NLP problems such as Machine Translation, Conversational Modeling, and Summarization. For more detailed coverage, I encourage you to read Cezanne Camacho's article on [CNNs for Text Classification](https://cezannec.github.io/CNN_Text_Classification/).
